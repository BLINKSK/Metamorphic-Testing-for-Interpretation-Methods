# Metamorphic-Testing-for-Interpretation-Methods
This is the repository for the paper "One Step Further: Evaluating Interpretation Methods Using Metamorphic Testing" submitted to ICSE 2022.  
The systematical evaluation and metamorphic testing for interpretation methods are implemented here.
# Constuction
Folder "interpretation_methods" shows seven methods for metamorphic testing. Interpretation methods except LIME are realized by using TorchRay, available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/TorchRay. We realize LIME by its own individual implementation at https://github.com/marcotcr/lime.
